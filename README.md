## **ASCII-fy - Live ASCII webcam filter**

*Final project for CPSC-20000 (Intro to Computer Science), Fall 2022*


Made with Python.

Requires OpenCV and curses libraries to be installed separately before running.

Written and tested on Windows. I intend to keep updating and test it on Linux soon, but I have no idea yet if it works there or on Mac.
